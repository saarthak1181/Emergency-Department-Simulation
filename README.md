ABSTRACT : This study aims to optimise patient flow in emergency departments (ED) 
while minimising associated costs. In order to compare the effects of the 
optimisation, a simulation model for emergency departments has been 
implemented using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and queuing theory. 
Principally, a discrete event based, multi-class, multi-server queuing network 
is designed considering the emergency department as a set of stages each 
associated with a queue of patients waiting to be served. Each stage has 
multiple service providers such as Nurses, Doctors or other staff. We also 
classified patients passing through the stages according to their acuity level 
and personal characteristics. Then, a function is defined to measure the ED 
performance in respect to the calculated wait times and the cost.

CONCLUSION
After implementing multiple simulations,(Single server and Multi Servers), the 
factors, such as Average Queue length, Average Wait time ,that help decide if the 
Emergency Departments to be effective or not, are calculated. 
If the average wait time is low , doctor(server) utilisation is high and the average 
queue length is low, the Emergency Departments are said to be effective. 
To increase the efficiency of the ED’s even more, more servers can be added, 
given the cost and the serving entities are not fluctuated by a significant amount. 
Note: These results stand true for similarly sized hospitals. They can be 
further extended to work with hospitals with different parameters
